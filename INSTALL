INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

== Installing Python ==

First you need to have Python installed, which you probably will if
you are running an Unix or Mac system, and probably not if you are
running a Windows system.

Python can be found here:

http://www.python.org/

Its installation instructions should also be at that site.

== Creating a distribution-grade package (optional) ==

There are two probable ways that you could have gotten this program
in:
1. Directly from version control. (probably also packaged)
2. From a distribution-grade .tar.gz package.
(You can tell the difference (at least for now) that version control
contains the java/ directory, which is not included in any
distribution-grade package.)

If you want to create a distribution-grade package run:

python setup.py sdist

This will create a distribution-grade package in the dist/ directory.

== Installing ==

Run:

python setup.py install

or if you need root access

sudo python setup.py install

For more documentation about how the installer work, see:
