== Goals ==

=== Rules level calculations ===

Priority: High

- Missing: turrets
- Booby trap
- Mixed tech not taken into account

=== Add missing mechs to database ===

Priority: Medium - High

Comment: Not really a programming task. Waiting for SSW bugfixes for
3055 Solaris mechs, which has highest priority. Also wait for the
addition of year info to catch up.


- 3055 Solaris mechs (lights done)
- XTRO Primitives II
- WoR: Supplementals
- Turning Points series
- Dossiers
- Klondike industrial mechs
- Starter books
- Era Digests

=== Test data into repository ===

Priority: Medium - nice to have, but not vital.

- Add test data:
-- 3025: rest of 55 original mechs
-- 3050: 16 Clan omnis (wait for year data for U configs)

=== Disutils ===

Priority: Medium

- Complete setup.py: url, desciptions ...
- Include TODO or not?

=== Year Info stuff ===

Priority: Editing .ssw files: High, adding filters & check: Medium

Comment: Not really a programming task.

- Add year info to mechs, missing:
- 3055
- 3085

TODO: 3055, 3085

- Missing year info
-- Clint CLNT-2-4T (3039)
-- Thug THG-11E Reich (3050)
-- Highlander HGN-694 (3050)
-- Stooping Hawk Prime, A, B, C, D, E (3060)
-- Von Rohrs VON 4RH-6 (3075)

- Add year filter, once all mechs have up-to-date year info

- Add a check if year and era match up.

=== Weight calculations ===

Priority: Medium

- Weight calculations - detect under-weight mechs
- Turret weights
- Modular armor weight needs to be added up


=== Turn hackish implementations into real items ===

Priority: Medium

Comment: This requires the items to be implemented as objects, instead
of hacks in their parent object.

- Null sig, chameleon, void sig
- Tarcomp, CASE, Armored locations, AES
- Turrets


=== Battleforce ===

Priority: Low.

Comment: Bits and pieces of BF has been added due to being useful
elsewhere, no real need for complete BF info at this point.

- BattleForce information
- A lot to do
-- Weapon Damage
-- Overheat
-- Structure
-- Move special abilities scanning to class

-- Add missing Special Abilities:
--- ARTX (Missing: Thumper, Cruiser Missiles, Thumper Cannon, Sniper Cannon)
--- ARM - Armored Component
--- AC - Autocannon
--- BAR - special cases, not in use
--- BHJ - battlemech harjel - needs to track torsos
--- SHLD - battlemech shield
--- BT - booby trap
--- BRID - bridgelayer - not on mechs?
--- C#EM - C3 emergency master
--- CASE/CASEII
--- ENE - energy
--- ENG - engineering
--- FLK - flak
--- HT - heat
--- HPG - hyperpulse generator
--- IF - indirect fire
--- LRM
--- MEL - melee
--- MAS/LMAS - mimetic armor system
--- MDS - mine dispenser
--- MHQ - mobile headquarters
--- OMNI
--- RCN - recon (Missing: communications equip, special recon stuff)
--- SAW
--- SRM
--- STL - stealth
--- TOR - torpedo
--- TSM
--- TUR - turret
--- UMU


=== Cost calculations ===

Priority: Low

Comment: All the issues needs to be checked if the problem is in the
code or in SSW.

- Modular armor -- TODO
- Ammo -- Done costs, code missing, not used in dry costs

==== Cost Issues ====
- Some dual cockpit issue
- Turret cost: GOL-6M
- Retractable blade
- Talons (which way is right?)
- Unknown issues:
-- Hatamoto-Kaeru
-- Banzai - booby trap?
-- BattleMaster BLR- 6X
-- Hunchback HBK-7X-4 - torso cockpit?
-- Thunder Fox C3 - mechanical jump boosters?
-- Legionnaire Muse Fire - torso cockpit?
-- Wraith Alexander - Partial Wing?

=== Other ===

- Also handle combat vehicles?
- Law of Demeter, avoid accessing low-level object data
- Better file & path handling
- missing ammo, missing TO stuff
- Tacops Clan reactive, modular & patchwork armor

- Handle armored components better
- Handle M-pods (should work on this end, problem in SSW)

- Handle modular armor better, make it work with omni loadouts.

- Make CASE handling less hackish

- Scan for maximum damage range?




== weapons.py ==
- Track if linked to tarcomp?
- ammo issue, try to avoid using both ammocount & ammo_ton. 
- Split WEAPONS into weapon types.

== gear.py ==
- Split WEAPONS into weapon types.
- Handle Tarcomp & CASE better.
- Move weight calculations.

- Supercharger class: track location - solves armored component problem?

== physical.py ==

- Missing: Medium Shield, industrial equipment

== report.py ==

- Additional checking:
-- torso bombs
-- OS launchers
-- ranged weapon heat
-- melee weapon without TSM
-- omni fixed heat sinks
-- good armor 1.1-1.25xIS

- LRM report:
-- BF LRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- MML ammo issue
- SRM report:
-- BF SRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- MML ammo issue
- Autocannon report:
-- BF AC value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- Tarcomp status

- Check for possible upgrades (add an -u switch)
-- SHSs --> DHSs
-- AC/10 --> LB 10-X or LGR
-- 2xMG --> 2xSPL

== summary.py ==

- Add header that describes the different types of output.

- List special equipment:
-- Stealth
-- Artillery

- Allow filtering by tonnage range.

- Count and list specific weapon types
-- Head-capper list: iHLL, PPC + Cap

- Range type listing:
-- Allow selection of range instead of using separate switches for
   each range. (Problem due to how the code internals works.)

- Add ability to filter out L and XL engines (a cheap mechs only filter.)
-- Implement cost and use that instead

- Speed listing:
-- Show UMU, liquid cargo for space

- LRM listing:
-- Missile boat score: tubes * ammo? Heat? 
--- Light: 10 tubes, Medium: 20 tubes, Heavy: 30 tubes, Assault: 40 tubes
--- Average damage

- Filter by source




== Mech type flow chart ==

Fast (5+) vs Slow (4-): 
- Fast --> Scout, Skirmisher, Striker
- Slow --> Brawler, Juggernaut, Sniper, Missile Boat

==================================
First off, I would keep each maneuver element uniform in speed, if possible, to allow for rapid deployment of faster elements when needed.
Second, I would try to keep a 1:1:1 distribution between 4/6, 5/8 and 6/9+ mechs. I would use 3/5 assaults only if I had a large force (battalion or bigger), or even use them as an independent attachment.
Third, each maneuver element needs at least one jumper unit, one fire support unit and one well armored suited for head-on engagement.

As I see it, this scheme would work both for an independent company or a battalion.

An example TRO 3039 (standard models only) independent company:
"Light Lance" (speed 6+):
- Scorpion
- Firestarter
- Phoenix Hawk
- Wolfhound
"Medium Lance" (speed 5):
- Trebuchet
- Griffin
- Wolverine
- Crab
"Heavy Lance" (speed 4):
- Archer
- Thug
- Grasshopper
- Thunderbolt

For a battalion I would keep the companies uniform in speed, and give each company a fire-support lance, a skirmish/recon lance and a trooper lance. (Hmm, Command Lance, Fire Lance, and Recon Lance, that is really a classic going back to the Black Widow company at least.)
