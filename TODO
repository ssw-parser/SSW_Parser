== Goals ==

=== Refactor code for a MVC model ===

Priority: Medium-High

=== Fetch unit availability lists from MUL ===

Priority: Medium-High

Comment: Fetching is working, extracting data from the HTML needs
work.

=== Create command analyzer ===

Priority: Medium-High

Comment: Add capability to analyze a command consisting of multiple units.

=== Add missing mechs to database ===

Priority: Medium

Comment: Not really a programming task. Catch up with combat vehicles
before adding more mechs first.

- XTRO: Phantoms
- Turning Points series (quite high priority, due to some design
  showing up on faction lists)
- Dossiers/Lance packs
- Starter books
- WoR: Supplementals (wait for MUL)
- Klondike industrial mechs (low priority, since this program does not
  handle industrial mechs (at least for now).)

Primitive Jump-jets:
- Change Wasp WSP-1 to use primitive jump-jets when available.

=== Add missing combat vehicles to database ===

Priority: Medium

Comment: The main issue here is the Clan CASE bug that makes me
unwilling to start on sources with Clan vehicles.

TODO:
- 3058 Heavy, Assault & Star League
- 3060
- 3075
- 3085
- Klondike -- Note that most vehicles uses Klondike-specific gear.
- XTROs  -- Note that a lot of Experimental equipment is missing from SAW.

- Missing Record Sheets:
- Sea Skimmer Hydrofoil (3039)
- Monitor Naval Vessel (3039)
- Neptune Submarine (3039)

=== Support Combat Vehicles ===

Priority: Medium-High

- Add support for omni-vehicles.
- Bugchecking and cleanup.
- Type list (summary.py) is broken for combat vehicles. (low priority)
- Costs needs to be debugged and missing stuff needs to be added.
- CASE will at least need some modifications. (seems to work?!)
- Trailers probably quite buggy.
- Support naval units.
- Support WiGE untis.

- Adapt report.py to be able to deal with combat vehicles.

- Issue with some vehicles showing up as intro-tech, while others are
  T-L. Intro-tech should probably be limited to mechs?

=== Test data into repository ===

Priority: Medium

Comments: This issue here is how much test data to include. I am
unwilling to add anything introduced after 3052. I am also unwilling
to inflate the size of the archive with too many files.

- Add test data:
-- 3050: 16 Clan omnis? (wait for Z configs?)
-- 3039: Probably a better idea than 3050?

=== Disutils ===

Priority: Medium

Comments: Do this when ready for release.

- Add missing diretories: doc, demo?
- Distribute generated documentation with package.

=== Documentation ===

Priority: Medium-High

- Add more documentation.
- Formated docstrings.
- Create a man page?

=== Year Info stuff ===

Priority: Medium (need MUL to update)

Comments: Nothing that can be done right now. (Except pestering the
MUL team.)

- Consider making failed year-era check non-interrupting?

- Missing year info, Mechs in MUL:

=== Turn hackish implementations into real items ===

Priority: Medium

Comment: This requires the items to be implemented as objects, instead
of hacks in their parent object.

- CASE -- Issue: The way CASE information is stored.
- Tarcomp -- Issue: The way the code access current tarcomp variable.
- Armored Locations -- Issue: Need to know which items are armored.
- Turrets

=== Input File handling ===

Priority: Medium

Comment: Implementing the filter is easy, figuring out how to input
the info on desired configs into the program is hard.

- Find a way to select which omni-configs are desired.


=== Improve upgrade evaluator in report.py ===

Priority: Medium

- Better ammo handling for Class A & B (know minimum required ammo for upgrades)

- Consider suggesting engine size changes if very big or very small

Class A Refit:
- Weapon replacements
- Same category
- Same or fewer critical spaces (including ammo)

Class B Refit:
- As above, but no category limit

Class C Refit:
- As above, but allow more critical spaces
- Also allows armor changes
- Also allows addition of heat sinks and ammo

Class D Refit:
- Allows addition of new gear
- Allow changing heatsink type
- Allow changing engine rating

=== Make report.py more useful ===

-- Tarcomp status

=== Add more selectors to summary.py ===

Priority: Medium

- Transmission type filters? (VTOL done)
-- Mech or Combat vehicle?
-- Ground only?

- Filter by source

- Add ability to filter out L and XL engines (a cheap mechs only filter.)

=== Support Industrial Mechs ===

Priority: Low

Comment: I honestly does not care about them, since I have no desire
of using Industrials in combat. The main gain would be that they use
equipment not used on BattleMechs, giving me a reason to implement
said pieces of gear.

=== Battleforce ===

Priority: Low

Comment: Bits and pieces of BF has been added due to being useful
elsewhere, no real need for complete BF info at this point. The
structure point calculation is a major issue to me, since that seems a
lot of work for so little gain.

Note that the Battleforce calculations and missing stuff has not been
updated for some time, so Combat Vehicle exclusive stuff is missing
from the list below.

- BattleForce information
- A lot to do
-- Weapon Damage
-- Overheat
-- Structure
-- Move special abilities scanning to class

-- Add missing Special Abilities:
--- ARTX (Missing: Thumper, Cruiser Missiles, Thumper Cannon, Sniper Cannon)
--- ARM - Armored Component
--- AC - Autocannon
--- BAR - special cases, not in use
--- BHJ - battlemech harjel - needs to track torsos
--- SHLD - battlemech shield
--- BT - booby trap
--- BRID - bridgelayer - not on mechs?
--- C#EM - C3 emergency master
--- CASE/CASEII
--- ENE - energy
--- ENG - engineering
--- FLK - flak
--- HT - heat
--- HPG - hyperpulse generator
--- IF - indirect fire
--- LRM
--- MEL - melee
--- MAS/LMAS - mimetic armor system
--- MDS - mine dispenser
--- MHQ - mobile headquarters
--- OMNI
--- RCN - recon (Missing: communications equip, special recon stuff)
--- SAW
--- SRM
--- STL - stealth
--- TOR - torpedo
--- TSM
--- TUR - turret
--- UMU


=== Cost calculations ===

Priority: Low

Comment: All the issues needs to be checked if the problem is in the
code or in SSW.

- Modular armor -- TODO
- Ammo -- Done costs, code missing, not used in dry costs
- Cost of variable weight items are most probably wrong.

==== Cost Issues ====
- Some dual cockpit issue
- Retractable blade
- Talons (which way is right?)
- Unknown issues:
-- Banshee BNC-1E
-- Mackie MSK-5S & Mackie MSK-6S
-- Hatamoto-Kaeru
-- Banzai
-- BattleMaster BLR- 6X
-- Hunchback HBK-7X-4 - torso cockpit?
-- Thunder Fox C3 - mechanical jump boosters?
-- Legionnaire Muse Fire - torso cockpit?
-- Wraith Alexander - Partial Wing?


=== Other ===

- Law of Demeter, avoid accessing low-level object data

- Move get_move_target_modifier to util to avoid excessive code duplication.

- Handle armored components better
- Handle M-pods (should work on this end, problem in SSW)

- Handle modular armor better, make it work with omni loadouts.

- Make CASE handling less hackish

- Scan for maximum damage range?

- Move shots/ton info for ammo to weapons?

- Able to use tuples as keys?

- Lists of allowed/not-allowed gear, for filtering units in custom
  settings. (This would probably require much work.)


== movement.py ==

Priority: Medium

- Move speed calculation out of engine class. Does not belong when
  using combat vehicles.

- Missing Engines: Fuel Cell, Fission

== weapons.py ==

- Track if linked to tarcomp?
- ammo issue, try to avoid using both ammocount & ammo_ton. 

== gear.py ==

- Handle Tarcomp & CASE better.
- Move weight calculations.

- Supercharger class: track location - solves armored component problem?

== summary.py ==

- Use a variable to select sorting for the BV lists.

- Armor list does not detect un-cased explosive stuff for combat vehicles.

- Figure out more uses for argument var.

- Use summary.py's own filters, instead of the is_xxx methods, so
  headers can be built.

- Infantry transport capability?

- Type_list is broken for combat vehicles.

- List special equipment:
-- Stealth
-- Artillery

- Count and list specific weapon types
-- Head-capper list: iHLL

- Cost/ton sorting for mechs?

- Speed listing:

-- Show UMU, liquid cargo for space

- Missile boat listing:
-- Allow non-LRM weapons (ELRMs, ATMs & Thunderbolts)?

- LRM listing:
-- Missile boat score: tubes * ammo? Heat? 
--- Light: 10 tubes, Medium: 20 tubes, Heavy: 30 tubes, Assault: 40 tubes
--- Average damage





== Mech type flow chart ==

Fast (5+) vs Slow (4-): 
- Fast --> Scout, Skirmisher, Striker
- Slow --> Brawler, Juggernaut, Sniper, Missile Boat

For Brawlers check that not plagued by minimum ranges.

==================================
First off, I would keep each maneuver element uniform in speed, if possible, to allow for rapid deployment of faster elements when needed.
Second, I would try to keep a 1:1:1 distribution between 4/6, 5/8 and 6/9+ mechs. I would use 3/5 assaults only if I had a large force (battalion or bigger), or even use them as an independent attachment.
Third, each maneuver element needs at least one jumper unit, one fire support unit and one well armored suited for head-on engagement.

As I see it, this scheme would work both for an independent company or a battalion.

An example TRO 3039 (standard models only) independent company:
"Light Lance" (speed 6+):
- Scorpion
- Firestarter
- Phoenix Hawk
- Wolfhound
"Medium Lance" (speed 5):
- Trebuchet
- Griffin
- Wolverine
- Crab
"Heavy Lance" (speed 4):
- Archer
- Thug
- Grasshopper
- Thunderbolt

For a battalion I would keep the companies uniform in speed, and give each company a fire-support lance, a skirmish/recon lance and a trooper lance. (Hmm, Command Lance, Fire Lance, and Recon Lance, that is really a classic going back to the Black Widow company at least.)
