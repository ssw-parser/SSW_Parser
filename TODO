== Goals ==

=== Add missing mechs to database ===

Priority: Medium

Comment: Not really a programming task.

- Turning Points series (quite high priority, due to some design
  showing up on faction lists)
- Era Digests
- Dossiers
- Starter books
- WoR: Supplementals (wait for MUL)
- Klondike industrial mechs (low priority, since this program does not
  handle industrial mechs (at least for now).)

Primitive Jump-jets:
- Change Wasp WSP-1 to use primitive jump-jets when available.

=== Add missing combat vehicles to database ===

Priority: Medium

- 3039
- 3050
- 3058
- 3060
- 3075
- 3085
- Klondike
- XTROs

- Missing Record Sheets:

- Cannot Build:
-- Harasser Missile Platform Leaping Lisa (3039) -- No vehicle jump-jets.

=== Support Combat Vehicles ===

Priority: Medium-High

- Suspension factors.
- Bugchecking and cleanup.
- Hitches needing special treatment?

=== Test data into repository ===

Priority: Medium - nice to have, but not vital.

- Add test data:
-- 3050: 16 Clan omnis (wait for Z configs?)

=== Disutils ===

Priority: Medium

- Complete setup.py: url, desciptions ...
- Include TODO or not?

=== Year Info stuff ===

Priority: Medium (need MUL to update)

- Missing year info, Mechs in MUL:
-- Clint CLNT-2-4T (3039)
-- Thug THG-11E Reich (3050)
-- Highlander HGN-694 (3050)
-- Stooping Hawk Prime, A, B, C, D, E (3060)
-- Von Rohrs VON 4RH-6 (3075)

- Missing/wrong year info, Combat Vehicles in MUL:
-- All standard APCs (3039)

=== Weight calculations ===

Priority: Medium

- Weight calculations - detect under-weight mechs
- Turret weights
- Modular armor weight needs to be added up


=== Turn hackish implementations into real items ===

Priority: Medium

Comment: This requires the items to be implemented as objects, instead
of hacks in their parent object.

- Null sig, chameleon, void sig
- AES
- CASE -- Issue: The way CASE information is stored.
- Tarcomp -- Issue: The way the code access current tarcomp variable.
- Armored Locations -- Issue: Need to know which items are armored.
- Turrets -- Issue: Need to keep track of weight of items mounted in it.

=== File handling ===

Priority: Medium

- Find a way be selective with omni-configs.

=== Improve upgrade evaluator in report.py ===

Priority: Medium

- Figure out a way to separate Class A & Class B
- Better ammo handling for Class A & B (know minimum required ammo for upgrades)

- Consider suggesting engine size changes if very big or very small

Class A Refit:
- Weapon replacements
- Same category
- Same or fewer critical spaces (including ammo)

Class B Refit:
- As above, but no category limit

Class C Refit:
- As above, but allow more critical spaces
- Also allows armor changes
- Also allows addition of heat sinks and ammo

Class D Refit:
- Allows addition of new gear
- Allow changing heatsink type
- Allow changing engine rating

=== Make report.py more useful ===

Priority: Medium

- Additional checking:
-- torso bombs
-- OS launchers
-- ranged weapon heat
-- melee weapon without TSM
-- omni fixed heat sinks
-- good armor 1.1-1.25xIS

- LRM report:
-- BF LRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- MML ammo issue
- SRM report:
-- BF SRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- MML ammo issue
- Autocannon report:
-- BF AC value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- Tarcomp status

=== Add missing gear ===

Priority: Medium

Missing from TM:
- MG Arrays, IS: 2MG, 2HMG, 4 HMG
- IS HMG
- IS LRT-20
- IS SRT-2
- IS SRT-6
- MG Arrays, CL: 2LMG, 2MG, 3MG, 2HMG
- CL Flamer (Vehicle)
- CL LRT-20
- Most one-shot launchers
- Most industrial gear
*non-weapons & physical weapons still to be checked*

Missing from TO:
*needs to be checked*

- Tacops Clan reactive, modular & patchwork armor
- missing ammo, missing TO stuff

Physical stuff:
- Missing: Medium Shield, industrial equipment


=== Support Industrial Mechs ===

Priority: Low

=== Battleforce ===

Priority: Low

Comment: Bits and pieces of BF has been added due to being useful
elsewhere, no real need for complete BF info at this point.

- BattleForce information
- A lot to do
-- Weapon Damage
-- Overheat
-- Structure
-- Move special abilities scanning to class

-- Add missing Special Abilities:
--- ARTX (Missing: Thumper, Cruiser Missiles, Thumper Cannon, Sniper Cannon)
--- ARM - Armored Component
--- AC - Autocannon
--- BAR - special cases, not in use
--- BHJ - battlemech harjel - needs to track torsos
--- SHLD - battlemech shield
--- BT - booby trap
--- BRID - bridgelayer - not on mechs?
--- C#EM - C3 emergency master
--- CASE/CASEII
--- ENE - energy
--- ENG - engineering
--- FLK - flak
--- HT - heat
--- HPG - hyperpulse generator
--- IF - indirect fire
--- LRM
--- MEL - melee
--- MAS/LMAS - mimetic armor system
--- MDS - mine dispenser
--- MHQ - mobile headquarters
--- OMNI
--- RCN - recon (Missing: communications equip, special recon stuff)
--- SAW
--- SRM
--- STL - stealth
--- TOR - torpedo
--- TSM
--- TUR - turret
--- UMU


=== Cost calculations ===

Priority: Low

Comment: All the issues needs to be checked if the problem is in the
code or in SSW.

- Modular armor -- TODO
- Ammo -- Done costs, code missing, not used in dry costs

==== Cost Issues ====
- Some dual cockpit issue
- Turret cost: GOL-6M
- Retractable blade
- Talons (which way is right?)
- Unknown issues:
-- Hatamoto-Kaeru
-- Banzai
-- BattleMaster BLR- 6X
-- Hunchback HBK-7X-4 - torso cockpit?
-- Thunder Fox C3 - mechanical jump boosters?
-- Legionnaire Muse Fire - torso cockpit?
-- Wraith Alexander - Partial Wing?

=== Other ===

- Law of Demeter, avoid accessing low-level object data

- Move get_move_target_modifier to util to avoid excessive code dublication.

- Handle armored components better
- Handle M-pods (should work on this end, problem in SSW)

- Handle modular armor better, make it work with omni loadouts.

- Make CASE handling less hackish

- Scan for maximum damage range?

- Move shots/ton info for ammo to weapons?

== movement.py ==

Priority: Medium

- Move speed calculation out of engine class. Does not belong when
  using combat vehicles.

- Add Suspension factors.

- Missing Engines: Fuel Cell, Fission

== weapons.py ==
- Track if linked to tarcomp?
- ammo issue, try to avoid using both ammocount & ammo_ton. 
- Split WEAPONS into weapon types.

== gear.py ==
- Split WEAPONS into weapon types.
- Handle Tarcomp & CASE better.
- Move weight calculations.

- Supercharger class: track location - solves armored component problem?

== summary.py ==

- Use a variable to select sorting for the BV lists.

- Use summary.py's own filters, instead of the is_xxx methods, so
  headers can be built.

- Figure out how to exclude missile boats from the sniper category.

- List special equipment:
-- Stealth
-- Artillery

- Allow filtering by tonnage range.

- Count and list specific weapon types
-- Head-capper list: iHLL

- Range type listing:
-- Allow selection of range instead of using separate switches for
   each range. (Problem due to how the code internals works.)

- Add ability to filter out L and XL engines (a cheap mechs only filter.)
-- Implement cost and use that instead
-- Cost/ton sorting for mechs?

- Speed listing:
-- Show UMU, liquid cargo for space

- LRM listing:
-- Missile boat score: tubes * ammo? Heat? 
--- Light: 10 tubes, Medium: 20 tubes, Heavy: 30 tubes, Assault: 40 tubes
--- Average damage

- Filter by source




== Mech type flow chart ==

Fast (5+) vs Slow (4-): 
- Fast --> Scout, Skirmisher, Striker
- Slow --> Brawler, Juggernaut, Sniper, Missile Boat

For Brawlers check that not plagued by minimum ranges.

==================================
First off, I would keep each maneuver element uniform in speed, if possible, to allow for rapid deployment of faster elements when needed.
Second, I would try to keep a 1:1:1 distribution between 4/6, 5/8 and 6/9+ mechs. I would use 3/5 assaults only if I had a large force (battalion or bigger), or even use them as an independent attachment.
Third, each maneuver element needs at least one jumper unit, one fire support unit and one well armored suited for head-on engagement.

As I see it, this scheme would work both for an independent company or a battalion.

An example TRO 3039 (standard models only) independent company:
"Light Lance" (speed 6+):
- Scorpion
- Firestarter
- Phoenix Hawk
- Wolfhound
"Medium Lance" (speed 5):
- Trebuchet
- Griffin
- Wolverine
- Crab
"Heavy Lance" (speed 4):
- Archer
- Thug
- Grasshopper
- Thunderbolt

For a battalion I would keep the companies uniform in speed, and give each company a fire-support lance, a skirmish/recon lance and a trooper lance. (Hmm, Command Lance, Fire Lance, and Recon Lance, that is really a classic going back to the Black Widow company at least.)
