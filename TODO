== UNABLE TO PARSE ==

Goshawk II 3.ssw -- armored components
Templar TLR1-OU -- missing due to no record sheets for main configs
Turkina U -- armored components
Phoenix Hawk IIC 8 -- improved jump-jets + XXL engine heat conflict
between MUL and SSW
Wolfhound WLF-2X -- A.E.S.
Grasshopper GHR-7X -- Torso-mounted Cockpit
Annihilator ANH-2AX - armored components

== UNABLE TO BUILD IN SSW ==

Schwerer Gustav -- Frankenmech

== PRIORITY ==
- Track Intro, TL, Advanced and Experimental
- Law of Demeter, avoid accessing low-level object data

== Goals ==
- Mech lists for Klondike, 3050 Star League, 3055 Solaris
- BattleForce infomation
- missing ammo, missing TO stuff
- Tacops armor
- Turret weights
- Things that needs to become real items:
-- Null sig, chameleon, void sig
-- Integrate fire control systems better (a4, a5, ap, tarcomp)

- Handle armored components (priority: head)
- Handle A.E.S.
- Handle Torso-mounted Cockpit BV

== weapons.py ==
- Track if linked to artemis, apollo or tarcomp?

== gear.py ==
- Split WEAPONS into weapon types.
- Merge physical, equipment dictionaries.
- Handle Supercharger better.
- Add rules level for stuff.
- Move weight calculations.

== ssw.py ==
- Rename? 

- Additional checking:
-- torso bombs
-- OS launchers
-- ranged weapon heat
-- melee weapon without TSM
-- omni fixed heat sinks
-- good armor 1.1-1.25xIS
- Move date calculations completely to mech.py (and its sub-classes)

- LRM report:
-- BF LRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- Artemis status
-- MML ammo issue
- SRM report:
-- BF SRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- MML ammo issue
-- Artemis status
- Autocannon report:
-- BF AC value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- Tarcomp status

== summary.py ==
- Rename?

- List special equipment:
-- ECM
-- Stealth
-- Artillery

- Allow filtering by tonnage.

- Count and list specific weapon types
-- Head-capper list: iHGR, iHLL, PPC + Cap, HPPC + Cap, ERPPC + Cap

- Sniper listing:
-- Allow selection of range

- Make default display more like MUL: Add rules.
-- Rules level filter.

- Add ability to filter out L and XL engines (a cheap mechs only filter.)

- Speed listing:
-- Show superchargers, UMU, liquid cargo for space

- Armor listing:
-- Armor type

- LRM listing:
-- Missile boat score: tubes * ammo? Heat? 
--- Light: 10 tubes, Medium: 20 tubes, Heavy: 30 tubes, Assault: 40 tubes
--- Average damage

- Filter by source

Suddenly I think of the idea of using something similar to the planetary tech ratings.  A-F grades on firepower, armor, mobility, and special gear, maybe.  It's going to be relatively vague and not "my mech is 135.2 points more than yours" and would certainly count as "close enough" - maybe per weight.  Maybe make it purely on tonnage...

Weapons as a percentage of 'Mech weight: <10%=F, 10-20=D, 20-35=C, 35-50=B, 50%+=A
Armor as a percentage of max value: <50%=F, 50-60=D, 60-75=C, 75-90=B, 90%+=A
Speed as a percentage of the max MP for its weight and engine, +1 level for jump jets: <50%=F, 50-60=D, 60-75=C, 75-90=B, 90%+=A
Special is ECM, Probe, C3, Narc, TAG, and similar: no gear is F, one piece of equipment is D, 2 is C, 3 is B, 4+ is A

Soooo...to pick a random 'Mech, the OSP-26.  Weapons, not counting CASE or the jump jets, comes to exactly 50% by mass.  Armor, 176/185=95% or so.  Speed, 4/7=~.58, so D, though +1 for jump jets.  The Probe gives it one point in special.  That gives you a final rating for an A/A/C/D machine, a good line 'Mech with moderate mobility and a little bit of EW capability.  Now the above is fully off the top of my head, I just thought of it when I saw the comment of vague ratings and remembered the planetary codes - so why not something similar?  It's certainly a lot easier to calculate than trying to figure BV...
