== Goals ==

=== Year Info stuff ===

- Add year info to mechs
-- Progress
--- 3039 done
--- 3050 done

- Missing, no year info
-- Clint CLNT-2-4T
-- Thug THG-11E Reich
-- Highlander HGN-694

- Add year filter

=== Battleforce ===

- BattleForce information
- A lot to do
-- Add count to Special Abilities where needed
-- Add missing Special Abilities
-- Weapon Damage
-- Overheat
-- Points
-- Structure
-- Move special abilities scanning to class

=== Rules level calculations ===

- Missing: turrets
- Booby trap

=== Cost calculations ===

- Modular armor -- TODO
- Ammo -- Done costs, code missing, not used in dry costs

====Cost Issues ====
- Some dual cockpit issue
- Turret cost: GOL-6M
- Retractable blade
- Talons (which way is right?)
- Unknown issues:
-- Hatamoto-Kaeru
-- Banzai - booby trap?
-- BattleMaster BLR- 6X
-- Hunchback HBK-7X-4 - torso cockpit?
-- Thunder Fox C3 - mechanical jump boosters?
-- Legionnaire Muse Fire - torso cockpit?
-- Wraith Alexander - Partial Wing?

=== Weight calculations ===

- Weight calculations - detect under-weight mechs
- Turret weights
- Modular armor weight needs to be added up



=== Other ===

- Also handle combat vehicles?
- Law of Demeter, avoid accessing low-level object data
- Better packaging: Distutils
- Better file & path handling
- Klondike industrial mechs, 3055 Solaris mechs, XTRO Primitives II, WoR
- missing ammo, missing TO stuff
- Tacops Clan reactive, modular & patchwork armor
- Things that needs to become real items:
-- Null sig, chameleon, void sig
-- Tarcomp, CASE, Armored locations, AES
-- Integrate fire control systems better (a4, a5, ap, tarcomp)
-- Turrets

- Handle armored components better
- Handle M-pods (should work on this end, problem in SSW)

- Handle modular armor better, make it work with omni loadouts.

- Make CASE handling less hackish

- Scan for maximum damage range?

== movement.py ==
- Use a dictionary for engine type info (Problematic, keys not unique)

== weapons.py ==
- Track if linked to tarcomp?
- ammo issue, try to avoid using both ammocount & ammo_ton. 
- Split WEAPONS into weapon types.

== gear.py ==
- Split WEAPONS into weapon types.
- Handle Tarcomp & CASE better.
- Move weight calculations.
- Modular armor weight.

- Supercharger class: track location - solves armored component problem?

== physical.py ==

- Missing: Medium Shield, Flail, industrial equipment

== report.py ==

- Additional checking:
-- torso bombs
-- OS launchers
-- ranged weapon heat
-- melee weapon without TSM
-- omni fixed heat sinks
-- good armor 1.1-1.25xIS

- LRM report:
-- BF LRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- MML ammo issue
- SRM report:
-- BF SRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- MML ammo issue
- Autocannon report:
-- BF AC value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- Tarcomp status

- Check for possible upgrades (add an -u switch)
-- SHSs --> DHSs
-- AC/10 --> LB 10-X or LGR
-- 2xMG --> 2xSPL

== summary.py ==

- Add header that describes the different types of output.

- List special equipment:
-- Stealth
-- Artillery

- Allow filtering by tonnage range.

- Count and list specific weapon types
-- Head-capper list: iHLL, PPC + Cap

- Range type listing:
-- Allow selection of range instead of using separate switches for
   each range. (Problem due to how the code internals works.)

- Add ability to filter out L and XL engines (a cheap mechs only filter.)
-- Implement cost and use that instead

- Speed listing:
-- Show UMU, liquid cargo for space

- LRM listing:
-- Missile boat score: tubes * ammo? Heat? 
--- Light: 10 tubes, Medium: 20 tubes, Heavy: 30 tubes, Assault: 40 tubes
--- Average damage

- Filter by source

== Mech type flow chart ==

Fast (5+) vs Slow (4-): 
- Fast --> Scout, Skirmisher, Striker
- Slow --> Brawler, Juggernaut, Sniper, Missile Boat

==================================
First off, I would keep each maneuver element uniform in speed, if possible, to allow for rapid deployment of faster elements when needed.
Second, I would try to keep a 1:1:1 distribution between 4/6, 5/8 and 6/9+ mechs. I would use 3/5 assaults only if I had a large force (battalion or bigger), or even use them as an independent attachment.
Third, each maneuver element needs at least one jumper unit, one fire support unit and one well armored suited for head-on engagement.

As I see it, this scheme would work both for an independent company or a battalion.

An example TRO 3039 (standard models only) independent company:
"Light Lance" (speed 6+):
- Scorpion
- Firestarter
- Phoenix Hawk
- Wolfhound
"Medium Lance" (speed 5):
- Trebuchet
- Griffin
- Wolverine
- Crab
"Heavy Lance" (speed 4):
- Archer
- Thug
- Grasshopper
- Thunderbolt

For a battalion I would keep the companies uniform in speed, and give each company a fire-support lance, a skirmish/recon lance and a trooper lance. (Hmm, Command Lance, Fire Lance, and Recon Lance, that is really a classic going back to the Black Widow company at least.)
