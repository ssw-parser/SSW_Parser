== UNABLE TO PARSE ==

=== Armored components stuff ===

Merlin MLN-SX -- armored components (engine)
Devastator DVS-X10 Muse Earth -- armored components (shoulders, hips,
 supercharger)
Atlas AS7-00 Jurn -- armored components (command console, SSW does not
add the BV for it.)
Beowulf BEO-X-7a -- armored components (gear)

=== Other reasons ===

Phoenix Hawk IIC 8 -- improved jump-jets + XXL engine heat conflict
between MUL and SSW
Victor VTR-9K2 St. James -- Patchwork armor
Juggernaut JG-R9TX1 Leapin Lil -- M-pod (SSW does not calculate
explosive penalty for M-pods)
Highlander HGN-732 Colleen -- Experimental Streaks

== RS NOT CONSTRUCTED DUE TO VARIOUS REASONS ==

Templar TLR1-OU (RS3085:ONN) -- missing due to no record sheets for main configs
Turkina U (RS3085:ONN) -- armored components (pod-mounted gear), omni-config
Celerity CLR-02-X-D (XTRO:Comstar) -- ultra-light

== UNABLE TO BUILD IN SSW ==

Schwerer Gustav (XTRO:Mercs) -- Frankenmech
Spatha SP2-X Warlord (XTRO:Gladiators) -- SSW calculates Sword crits incorrectly
WHM-X7 Warhammer The Lich (XTRO:Gladiators) -- Frankenmech
TMC-NB Temax Cat Ninjabolt (XTRO:Boondocks) -- Frankenmech
BL-9-KNT Black Knight (RS3050) -- SSW calculates Hatchet crits incorrectly
Banshee BNC-11X (XTRO:Steiner) -- Modular Armor
TBT-XK7 Trebuchet (XTRO:Periphery) -- Modular Armor
Grim Reaper Einer (XTRO:Comstar) -- Frankenmech

== PRIORITY ==
- Track Intro, TL, Advanced and Experimental
- Law of Demeter, avoid accessing low-level object data

== Goals ==

- Better packaging: Distutils
- Better file & path handling
- Klondike industrial mechs, 3055 Solaris mechs, XTRO Primitives II
- BattleForce information
- missing ammo, missing TO stuff
- Tacops Clan reactive, modular & patchwork armor
- Turret weights
- Things that needs to become real items:
-- Null sig, chameleon, void sig
-- Integrate fire control systems better (a4, a5, ap, tarcomp)

- Handle armored components (better) (priority: head, shoulders, hips)
- Handle M-pods (should work on this end, problem in SSW)

- Weight calculations - detect under-weight mechs
- Make CASE handling less hackish

- Remove unused specials.py?

== weapons.py ==
- Track if linked to tarcomp?

== gear.py ==
- Split WEAPONS into weapon types.
- Handle Supercharger better.
- Add rules level for stuff.
- Move weight calculations.

== physical.py ==

- Missing: Medium Shield, Flail, Chain Whip, industrial equipment

== report.py ==

- Additional checking:
-- torso bombs
-- OS launchers
-- ranged weapon heat
-- melee weapon without TSM
-- omni fixed heat sinks
-- good armor 1.1-1.25xIS

- LRM report:
-- BF LRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- MML ammo issue
- SRM report:
-- BF SRM value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- MML ammo issue
- Autocannon report:
-- BF AC value (remember low ammo reduction)
-- Tarcomp status

- Check for possible upgrades (add an -u switch)
-- SHSs --> DHSs
-- AC/10 --> LB 10-X or LGR
-- 2xMG --> 2xSPL

== summary.py ==

- Add header that describes the different types of output.

- List special equipment:
-- Stealth
-- Artillery

- Allow filtering by tonnage.

- Count and list specific weapon types
-- Head-capper list: iHLL, PPC + Cap

- Sniper listing:
-- Allow selection of range

- Make default display more like MUL: Add rules.
-- Rules level filter.

- Add ability to filter out L and XL engines (a cheap mechs only filter.)

- Speed listing:
-- Show superchargers, UMU, liquid cargo for space

- Armor listing:
-- Armor type

- LRM listing:
-- Missile boat score: tubes * ammo? Heat? 
--- Light: 10 tubes, Medium: 20 tubes, Heavy: 30 tubes, Assault: 40 tubes
--- Average damage

- Filter by source

Suddenly I think of the idea of using something similar to the planetary tech ratings.  A-F grades on firepower, armor, mobility, and special gear, maybe.  It's going to be relatively vague and not "my mech is 135.2 points more than yours" and would certainly count as "close enough" - maybe per weight.  Maybe make it purely on tonnage...

Weapons as a percentage of 'Mech weight: <10%=F, 10-20=D, 20-35=C, 35-50=B, 50%+=A
Armor as a percentage of max value: <50%=F, 50-60=D, 60-75=C, 75-90=B, 90%+=A
Speed as a percentage of the max MP for its weight and engine, +1 level for jump jets: <50%=F, 50-60=D, 60-75=C, 75-90=B, 90%+=A
Special is ECM, Probe, C3, Narc, TAG, and similar: no gear is F, one piece of equipment is D, 2 is C, 3 is B, 4+ is A

Soooo...to pick a random 'Mech, the OSP-26.  Weapons, not counting CASE or the jump jets, comes to exactly 50% by mass.  Armor, 176/185=95% or so.  Speed, 4/7=~.58, so D, though +1 for jump jets.  The Probe gives it one point in special.  That gives you a final rating for an A/A/C/D machine, a good line 'Mech with moderate mobility and a little bit of EW capability.  Now the above is fully off the top of my head, I just thought of it when I saw the comment of vague ratings and remembered the planetary codes - so why not something similar?  It's certainly a lot easier to calculate than trying to figure BV...
