PRIORITY:
- Track Intro, TL, Advanced and Experimental
- Law of Demeter, avoid accessing low-level object data

Goals:
- Mech lists for Klondike, Solaris, 3085*2 (cutting edge, ONN)
- Fix intro-dates: multi-slot, weapons, tarcomps, artemis & co, omni
- missing ammo, missing TO stuff
- Tacops armor
- move warnings.add & print_warning stuff outside defensive.py
- Turret year & weights
- Things that needs to become real items:
-- Null sig, chameleon, void sig year
-- Integrate fire control systems better (a4, a5, ap, tarcomp)

gear.py:
- Split WEAPONS into weapon types.
- Merge physical, equipment dictionaries.
- Supercharger year.
- Add rules level for stuff.
- Move weight calculations.

ssw.py:
- Additional checking:
-- torso bombs
-- OS launchers
-- ranged weapon heat
-- melee weapon without TSM
-- omni fixed heat sinks
-- good armor 1.1-1.25xIS
- Move date calculations completely to mech.py (and its sub-classes)

summary.py:
- List special equipment:
-- ECM
-- Stealth
-- Artillery

- Count and list specific weapon types
-- Head-capper list: AC20, UAC20, LB20, GR, HGR, HPPC, HLL, cERPPC,
   iHGR, BinL, iHLL, TB15, TB20
-- Sniping weapon list

- Make default display more like MUL: Add rules.
-- Rules level filter.

- Add ability to filter out L and XL engines (a cheap mechs only filter.)

- Speed listing:
-- Show superchargers, UMU, liquid cargo for space

- Armor listing:
-- Armor type

- Filter by source

movement.py:
- Replace IS XXL Engine BV factor once ssw uses new one.

Suddenly I think of the idea of using something similar to the planetary tech ratings.  A-F grades on firepower, armor, mobility, and special gear, maybe.  It's going to be relatively vague and not "my mech is 135.2 points more than yours" and would certainly count as "close enough" - maybe per weight.  Maybe make it purely on tonnage...

Weapons as a percentage of 'Mech weight: <10%=F, 10-20=D, 20-35=C, 35-50=B, 50%+=A
Armor as a percentage of max value: <50%=F, 50-60=D, 60-75=C, 75-90=B, 90%+=A
Speed as a percentage of the max MP for its weight and engine, +1 level for jump jets: <50%=F, 50-60=D, 60-75=C, 75-90=B, 90%+=A
Special is ECM, Probe, C3, Narc, TAG, and similar: no gear is F, one piece of equipment is D, 2 is C, 3 is B, 4+ is A

Soooo...to pick a random 'Mech, the OSP-26.  Weapons, not counting CASE or the jump jets, comes to exactly 50% by mass.  Armor, 176/185=95% or so.  Speed, 4/7=~.58, so D, though +1 for jump jets.  The Probe gives it one point in special.  That gives you a final rating for an A/A/C/D machine, a good line 'Mech with moderate mobility and a little bit of EW capability.  Now the above is fully off the top of my head, I just thought of it when I saw the comment of vague ratings and remembered the planetary codes - so why not something similar?  It's certainly a lot easier to calculate than trying to figure BV...
