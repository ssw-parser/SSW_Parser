Q: My system does not have Python installed, from where do I get it?
A: http://www.python.org/

Q: Why Python instead of Java?
A: Well, I started this project in Python, because I was more familiar
with it. I tried, and started a rewrite in Java, but the issues with
getting the tables implemented in it was not worth the effort.
