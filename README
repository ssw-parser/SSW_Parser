The SSW_Parser 'program suite' right now consists of two Python
programs that reads .ssw mech data files produced by Solaris Skunk Werks:
- summary.py that takes a list of mechs and output a summary based on
the command-line switches used.
- ssw.py that output a more detailed analysis of one mech.

summary.py is quite usable, ssw.py still needs work.

=== A brief overview of command-line arguments for summary.py ===

==== Input Switches ====
-f <file>: Reads a from the file a list of mech .ssw files.

<file>: A file name without switches, is expected to be a valid .ssw
file.

==== Output Switches ====
-b: Output that gives a summary of battle values, sorted by BV/ton.

-a: Output that gives a summary of armor status, sorted by percent of
 maximum armor.

-s: Output that gives a summary of speed, sorted by speed.

The default output is in flux right now.

==== Filter Switches ====
Only one of these will be used by the program, so using multiple ones
is pointless.

-t: Only list mechs that has a TAG, or other gear with the same
 functionality (C3 Master).

-c: Only list mechs that mounts C3 slaves.

-cm: Only list mechs that mounts C3 masters.

-ci: Only list mechs that mounts C3i.

-n: Only list mechs that mounts Narc launchers.

-i: Only list Inner Sphere techbase mechs.

-cl: Only list Clan techbase mechs.

-cc: Only list mechs with a Command Console.
