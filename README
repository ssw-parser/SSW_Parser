The SSW_Parser 'program suite' right now consists of two Python
programs that reads .ssw/.saw unit data files produced by Solaris
Skunk Werks & Solaris Armor Werks. (BattleMechs only for SSW,
Industrials are not supported.)

- summary.py that takes a list of units and output a summary based on
the command-line switches used.

- report.py that output a more detailed analysis of one mech. Note
  that report.py does not handle combat vehicles at this point.


summary.py is quite usable, report.py is quite raw and still needs work.

== A brief overview of command-line arguments for report.py ==

<file>: A file name without switches, is expected to be a valid .ssw
file.

-b: Add detailed battle value calculation to output.

-r: Add raw xml data (.ssw file dump) to output.

-u: List possible upgrades.

== A brief overview of command-line arguments for summary.py ==

=== Input Switches ===
-f <file>: Reads from the file a list of unit .ssw/.saw files. Lines that
begins with '#' are comments. However adding a line containing the
following: '#!cd <dir_name>' allows change of working directory, which
is useful when wanting to avoid putting the file containing the list
and the .ssw/.saw files in the same directory.
   
<file>: A file name without switches, is expected to be a valid .ssw
or .saw file.

=== Output Switches ===
-b: Output that gives a summary of battle values, sorted by BV/ton.

-bv: Output that gives a summary of battle values, sorted by BV.

-a: Output that gives a summary of armor status, sorted by armor points.

-s: Output that gives a summary of speed, sorted by speed.

-l: Output that gives a summary of lrm tubes, sorted by tubes.

-cap: Output a list of headcappers mounted on the unit, sorted by
 number of cappers.

-dr: Output a list of how max damage varies over range, sorted by
 short-range damage. (No heat taken into account.)

-r <d>: Output a list of weapons with reach <d> mounted on the unit, sorted
 by damage at range <d>. (Less strict in filtering out designs than -sn.)

-sn: Output a list of sniper weapons mounted on the unit, sorted
 by long-range damage.

-str: Output a list of strikers, sorted by damage.

-skir: Output a list of skirmishers. (Needs work.)

-brwl: Output a list of brawlers. (Needs work.)

-jug: Output a list of juggernauts. (Needs work.)

-mb: Output a list of missile boats.

-scout: Output a list of scouts.

-typ: Output info on which roles mechs qualify for. (Needs work,
 Combat Vehicles not supported.)

-ac: Output a list of autocannons that can use special ammo.

-srm: Output a list of srm tubes that can use special ammo, sorted by tubes.

-w: Output a list of weapons.

-mw: Output a list of main weapons. (Secondaries removed.)

-bf: Output Battle Force information. (incomplete)

-cost: Output cost information. Note that this listing is very much
 work in progress and that the cost calculations have not been
 debugged. (incomplete)

-weight: Output weight distribution information.

The default output (no switch) is modeled after the MUL.

=== Filter Switches ===

These switches are used to limit the number of units displayed.

-tag: Only list units that has a TAG, or other gear with the same
 functionality (C3 Master).

-c3s: Only list units that mounts C3 slaves.

-c3m: Only list units that mounts C3 masters.

-c3i: Only list units that mounts C3i.

-narc: Only list units that mounts Narc launchers.

-ecm: Only list units that mounts an ECM system.

-probe: Only list units that mounts an Active Probe.

-taser: Only list units that mounts a Battlemech Taser.

-i: Only list Inner Sphere techbase units.

-cl: Only list Clan techbase units.

-cc: Only list units with a Command Console.

-e <d>: Only list units that are available during era <d>. Where <d>
 can be 2 = SW-E, 3 = SW-L, 4 = Clan, 5 = CW, 6 = Jihad.

-y <d>: Only list units that are available at year <d>. That is units
 that has a introduction year of <d> or earlier. Extinction is not
 taken into account.

-se <d>: Only list units as fast as <d>.

-sf <d>: Only list units at least as fast as <d>.

-af <d>: Only list units at least <d> points of armor.

-lrm <d>: Only list units with at least <d> LRM tubes. Enhanced LRMs
 and MMLs count, Extended LRMs does not. Basically only tubes that
 can use standard LRM ammo variantions.

-npr: Only list non-primitive units.

-wgt <d>: Only list units of weight <d>.

-rule <d>: Only list units with rules level <d> or lower.
