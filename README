The SSW_Parser 'program suite' right now consists of two Python
programs that reads .ssw mech data files produced by Solaris Skunk Werks:
- summary.py that takes a list of mechs and output a summary based on
the command-line switches used.
- ssw.py that output a more detailed analysis of one mech.

summary.py is quite usable, ssw.py still needs work.
