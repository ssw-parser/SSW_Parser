The SSW_Parser 'program suite' right now consists of two Python
programs that reads .ssw mech data files produced by Solaris Skunk Werks:

- summary.py that takes a list of mechs and output a summary based on
the command-line switches used.

- report.py that output a more detailed analysis of one mech.

summary.py is quite usable, report.py is quite raw and still needs work.

=== A brief overview of command-line arguments for report.py ===

<file>: A file name without switches, is expected to be a valid .ssw
file.

-b: Add detailed battle value calculation to output.

-r: Add raw xml data (.ssw file dump) to output.

=== A brief overview of command-line arguments for summary.py ===

==== Input Switches ====
-f <file>: Reads a from the file a list of mech .ssw files.

<file>: A file name without switches, is expected to be a valid .ssw
file.

==== Output Switches ====
-b: Output that gives a summary of battle values, sorted by BV/ton.

-bv: Output that gives a summary of battle values, sorted by BV.

-a: Output that gives a summary of armor status, sorted by armor points.

-s: Output that gives a summary of speed, sorted by speed.

-l: Output that gives a summary of lrm tubes, sorted by tubes.

-sn: Output a list of long-range weapons mounted on the mech, sorted
 by long-range damage.

-cap: Output a list of headcappers mounted on the mech, sorted by
 number of cappers.

-r: Output a list of how max damage varies over range, sorted by
 short-range damage. (No heat taken into account.)

-str: Output a list of strikers, sorted by damage.

-skir: Output a list of skirmishers. (Needs work.)

-brwl: Output a list of brawlers. (Needs work.)

-jug: Output a list of juggernauts. (Needs work.)

-typ: Output info on which roles mechs qualify for.

-ac: Output a list of autocannons that can use special ammo.

-srm: Output a list of srm tubes that can use special ammo, sorted by tubes.

-w: Output a list of weapons.

-mw: Output a list of main weapons. (Secondaries removed.)

The default output (no switch) is modeled after the MUL.

==== Filter Switches ====

-tag: Only list mechs that has a TAG, or other gear with the same
 functionality (C3 Master).

-c3s: Only list mechs that mounts C3 slaves.

-c3m: Only list mechs that mounts C3 masters.

-c3i: Only list mechs that mounts C3i.

-narc: Only list mechs that mounts Narc launchers.

-ecm: Only list mechs that mounts an ECM system.

-probe: Only list mechs that mounts an Active Probe.

-taser: Only list mechs that mounts a Battlemech Taser.

-i: Only list Inner Sphere techbase mechs.

-cl: Only list Clan techbase mechs.

-cc: Only list mechs with a Command Console.

-e <d>: Only list mechs that are available during era <d>. Where <d>
 can be 2 = SW-E, 3 = SW-L, 4 = Clan, 5 = CW, 6 = Jihad.

-sf <d>: Only list mechs at least as fast as <d>.

-lrm <d>: Only list mechs with at least <d> LRM tubes. Enhanced LRMs
 and MMLs count, Extended LRMs does not. Basically only tubes that
 can use standard LRM ammo variantions.

-npr: Only list non-primitive mechs.

-wgt <d>: Only list mechs of weight <d>.

-rule <d>: Only list mechs with rules level <d> or lower.
